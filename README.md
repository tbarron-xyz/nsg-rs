# nsg-rs

This is a Rust project implementing algorithms for numerical semigroups, focusing on computing factorizations of elements using dynamic programming with caching. It provides both single-threaded and parallel implementations for performance comparison.

## Key Features

- `NumericalSemigroup` struct with generators
- `DynamicFactorizationsContext` for cached factorization computation
- Single-threaded factorization: `factorizations_dynamic_singleThread(&mut self, alpha: i32) -> Vec<Vec<i32>>`
- Parallel factorization: `factorizations_dynamic_parallel(&mut self, alpha: i32) -> Vec<Vec<i32>>`

The `main.rs` demo computes factorizations of 5000 for semigroup generated by {13,33,37}, timing both parallel and serial approaches.

## Dependencies

- `futures` (0.3.31)
- `itertools` (0.12.1)

## Build and Run

To build: `cargo build --release`

To run demo: `cargo run --bin numerical-semigroup`
